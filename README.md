This project is a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Dashboard that includes a PCAP file analyzer. It is built using Next.js and relies on `tshark`, the command-line version of Wireshark, to parse PCAP files for analysis.

## Features

- Upload and analyze `.pcap` files directly from a browser  
- Simple dashboard interface  
- Uses `tshark` for fast and reliable packet capture analysis  
- Built with Next.js for modern performance and scalability

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)  
- `npm` (comes with Node.js)
